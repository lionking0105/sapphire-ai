# Sapphire AI: AI-Powered Recruitment Assistant

## Overview

Sapphire AI is a tool designed to automate the recruitment process by utilizing artificial intelligence. It focuses on generating personalized emails and managing recruitment data, aiming to simplify the outreach process to potential candidates.

### Important Note

For me this project served as an opportunity for me to improve my front-end software engineering skills, leading to a product with a polished and user-friendly interface. Consequently, the back-end development, while functional, is less comprehensive, reflecting the focus on the aesthetic and interactive aspects of the application. Similarly, there are many placeholder elements of the UI.

A secondary goal of this project was to explore the Open AI API and potential for sales and marketing technology.

**Again, this isn't in a super polished state, as I only spent about 8 hours building this.**
